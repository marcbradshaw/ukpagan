# Welcome to UK Pagan

For Pagans of all paths, and for Pagans of none.

UK Pagan has been an online home and discussion place since being founded in 2001.
 We pride ourselves on providing a safe space for active debate and conversation,
 and a place where followers of other religions are welcome providing they show respect and tolerance.

We strive to be a place for all Pagans, whatever path, whatever stage of their learning;
 a place where Pagans discuss issues with tolerance and respect for others;
 and a neutral forum with no "site line" or "site view".

We are made for the community and by the community.
