# The UK Pagan Code of Conduct

**Contact**: The moderation team

## Conduct

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
* Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* People have differences of opinion. There is seldom a right answer. That's no reason to be rude. Respect other points of view.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the <a href="http://citizencodeofconduct.org/">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. Don't use the private messaging service to break these rules. If you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the moderation team immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct.

* If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the moderation team.
* Remarks that violate the UK Pagan standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
* Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
* Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
  If the warning is unheeded, the user may be placed on 'pre-mod' - that is, their posts will have to wait for a moderator to approve them before they appear on the forum.
* If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
* Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
* If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Complaints about bans on site are not allowed.
* Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.
* Where possible, if a moderator has participated in a thread, they will leave moderation of that thread to another moderator.
* If a moderator edits contributed content they will make it clear, in context, that the content has been altered by a moderator and why.

## Threads and posts

* Excepting spam, we do not usually delete threads.
* Deleting posts from a thread after you post them is not encouraged, as it makes the thread conversation difficult to understand.
* Help us to keep things tidy, please stick to the topic of the area and the thread. If you wish to discuss on a tangent please start a new thread. If you're not sure where to post something, don't worry. The mods may move your post and let you know if it works better in another section of the forum.

## Personal information

* Please keep yourselves safe, don't post anything you would not want to become public.
* Posting personal contact details is discouraged, please exchange personal details via private messages instead.
* The contents of personal messages are not to be posted in the forums without consent of both parties.

## General

In this community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Try to be your best self and to practice respect and tolerance for all opinions. Don't deliberately set out to be offensive. Remember that some people may be undergoing all sorts of issues in real life that you have no idea about. Don't add to the stress. We won't tolerate people being driven away through bad behaviour by a poster.

If someone takes issue with something you said or did, try not to be defensive or aggressive in your response. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. It's usually down to a misunderstanding. Remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow site members comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about paganism. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official UK Pagan venues; including official website forums, Facebook page and groups, Google+ community, and Twitter.
